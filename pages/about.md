I'm a software and computer engineer, currently at Align Technology. My interests include Graphics, Vision, and Mixed Reality. I'm further interested in understanding how technology can be applied to health to improve the human experience.

My background lies in BME, EE, and CS, where I have done signal Processing research with EEG signals, AR Development in Unity, and Swift development in visionOS. One of my aspirations is to make a full-game, full movie, and full animation series.

I also love learning languages, and I want to learn all the languages of the world. If you'd like to talk to me, I would love to learn your language as well. Perhaps you can guess which ones I am better or worse at from the languages below.

Aside from the above, I also enjoy drawing, music, playing piano, running, hiking, and watching TV shows. Feel free to reach out to me about anything!
