# About

I'm a student at Duke University studying ECE/CS and Japanese. My interests include Computer Graphics, Mixed Reality, and how technology can be integrated with art. I am also generally related in the health applications of technology. 

I love drawing, music, playing piano, running, and watching TV shows. Feel free to reach out to me about anything!
